"""Trick 28: Multi-resolution generation with scorer-aware upsampling.

Compress at half resolution (~4x rate savings), then upsample with a
learned upsampler trained against the scorer. The key insight: PoseNet
operates on 256x512 internally (it has its own resize), so half-resolution
input loses almost nothing after PoseNet's internal downscale. SegNet is
more resolution-sensitive, but a class-boundary-aware upsampler preserves
mIoU.

Pipeline:
    Full-res frames -> downsample 2x -> codec compress -> decode ->
    LearnedUpsampler -> full-res output -> scorer

The upsampler is a tiny model (< 10K params) that fits in archive.zip
with negligible rate cost. The rate savings from halving resolution are
enormous -- 3-4x on typical video codecs.

This module provides:
    - LearnedUpsampler: sub-pixel conv upsampler with boundary awareness
    - MultiResPostFilter: wraps any base postfilter to work at half-res
    - downsample_for_codec / upsample_from_codec: utility transforms
