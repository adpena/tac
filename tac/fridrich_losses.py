# ── JPEG luminance quantization table (ITU-T T.81 Annex K, Table K.1) ──────
#
# This is the canonical quality=50 luminance Q-table that JPEG encoders use
# to scale DCT coefficients before integer rounding. It encodes the human
# visual system's frequency sensitivity curve: low spatial frequencies (top-
# left of the 8x8 block) have small divisors (16-26) — humans see errors
# there clearly; high frequencies (bottom-right) have large divisors (95-99)
# — humans cannot see errors there.
#
# Fridrich's inverse-steganalysis principle: scorer CNNs (EfficientNet-B2 +
# FastViT-T12) likely inherit a similar low-frequency bias from training on
# natural images. By weighting our DCT-domain residual loss by 1/Q, we
# penalize residual energy in low-freq bins much more than high-freq bins
# (a unit coefficient in the (0,0) bin costs (1/16)² ≈ 38× more than in the
# (7,7) bin), concentrating renderer error into directions the scorers
# cannot detect.

    """JPEG-Q-table-weighted DCT-domain residual loss (Fridrich council #1).

    For each 8×8 block of the residual `rendered - gt` (in luma or per-RGB),
    take the orthonormal 2D DCT-II and weight each frequency coefficient by
    1/Q_jpeg[i,j] where Q_jpeg is the standard ITU-T T.81 luminance table.
    Sum the squared weighted coefficients as the loss.

    The mechanism (see module docstring on JPEG_LUMA_Q_TABLE): scorer CNNs
    inherit human-visual-system-like frequency sensitivity, which JPEG's
    Q-table already encodes. The loss contribution of one unit of DCT
    coefficient energy is (coeff / Q[i,j])², so a unit residual in the
    (0,0) DC bin costs (1/16)² ≈ 3.9e-3 while the same in the (7,7)
    HF bin costs (1/99)² ≈ 1.0e-4 — a ~38× cheaper hiding place. The
    renderer responds by concentrating its inevitable approximation error
    in the DCT directions the scorer cannot see — a direct UNIWARD analog
    in the DCT domain.

    Caveat (Yousfi council audit): the JPEG luminance Q-table encodes the
    HVS frequency-sensitivity curve. Our scorers (EfficientNet-B2 +
    FastViT-T12) likely inherit a similar low-freq bias from training on
