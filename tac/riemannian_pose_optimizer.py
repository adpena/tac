"""Riemannian SGD on SE(3) for Lane RM pose TTO.

This optimiser implements the Riemannian gradient descent recipe of
Bonnabel (2013) on the SE(3) manifold:

    1. Compute the Euclidean gradient of the loss with respect to the
       (axis-angle ω, translation t) parameterisation of each pose.
    2. Project that gradient onto the tangent space at the current point
       (with the canonical left-invariant metric on SE(3) the projection
       is the identity — see ``riemannian_gradient_se3``).
    3. Take a geodesic step via the SE(3) exponential map; the rotation
       update is multiplicative (R_new = R · exp(η̂)), guaranteeing that
       the rotation factor remains in SO(3) up to floating-point
       round-off.
    4. (Optional) Riemannian momentum: parallel-transport the previous
       velocity vector along the geodesic before adding it to the new
       gradient; for SE(3) with the left-invariant metric the parallel
       transport along a left-multiplication geodesic is a no-op on the
       Lie-algebra coordinates (Sola Eq. 174), so we implement momentum
       as a vector accumulator in se(3) coordinates.

Pose-tensor contract
--------------------
This optimiser interprets each row of a parameter tensor of shape
``(N, 6)`` (or batched ``(..., 6)``) as a single SE(3) element split as
``(ω ∈ ℝ³, t ∈ ℝ³)``; ``ω`` is axis-angle (so ``omega = log_map_so3(R)``)
and ``t`` is the Cartesian translation. This matches the comma.ai PoseNet
6-vector output, where the first three dims are angular and the last
three are translational. Tensors with a last-dim other than 6 are
rejected at ``step()`` time to fail loud rather than silently corrupt a
LoRA / radial-zoom parameterisation.

Why a custom optimiser (instead of running plain SGD then re-projecting)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Correctness: a Euclidean SGD step on (ω, t) does NOT correspond to a
  geodesic on SO(3) — it accumulates orthogonality error which compounds
  across steps. The exponential-map composition does so by construction.
* Convergence: Bonnabel (2013) shows Riemannian SGD attains the same
  asymptotic convergence rate as Euclidean SGD on smooth manifolds, but
  with a constant factor improved by the manifold curvature when the
  parameter space has nontrivial structure (which SO(3) does — its
  diameter under the Frobenius metric is bounded, while ℝ³ is not).
* Specifically for the pose TTO loop: per
  ``project_posenet_rank1_discovery``, dim 0 of the pose carries 99.8%
  of the variance and lies on a near-trivial manifold, while dims 1-5
  are nuisance directions on a compact submanifold (effectively SO(3)).
  A Riemannian optimiser stays on that submanifold by construction;
  Euclidean SGD wanders off it.

class RiemannianSGD(Optimizer):
    """Riemannian SGD on SE(3) with optional Lie-algebra momentum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params : iterable of parameter tensors
        Each tensor's last dim must be 6 — interpreted as
        ``(ω_x, ω_y, ω_z, t_x, t_y, t_z)``.
    lr : float
        Geodesic step size; descent direction is ``-grad`` so the
        effective step is ``-lr · grad``.
    momentum : float, default 0.0
        Riemannian momentum coefficient β. The velocity buffer lives in
        se(3) coordinates: ``v_{k+1} = β · v_k + grad`` and the geodesic
        step uses ``-lr · v_{k+1}`` (Polyak heavy-ball formulation). With
        the left-invariant metric, parallel transport on the Lie algebra
        is the identity (Sola §6), so no transport correction is needed
        between steps.
    weight_decay : float, default 0.0
        L2 penalty on the (ω, t) coordinates added to the gradient before
        the momentum update — exactly as in ``torch.optim.SGD``. Note that
        an L2 penalty in the chart is not a manifold-intrinsic regulariser;
        it biases the optimiser toward the origin of the chart, which for
        axis-angle is the identity rotation. Default 0 leaves behaviour
        unchanged.

    Notes
    -----
    * If a parameter has no gradient (``param.grad is None``), it is
      skipped — same convention as ``torch.optim.SGD``.
    * The optimiser is *non-differentiable*: ``step()`` mutates parameters
      in-place under ``torch.no_grad`` and detaches the result. Do not
      backprop through it.
