"""Lock-in tests for the 2026-04-26 SHIRAZ-class bugs.

Two bug classes burned ~21h of A100 time on 2026-04-26:

1. **Suffix-based pose dispatch.** A wrapper renamed `optimized_poses_partial.pt`
   (a torch.save pickle) to `optimized_poses.bin` (raw fp16 buffer). The auth
   eval loader called `torch.frombuffer(..., dtype=float16).reshape(-1, 6)` on
   a pickle file and crashed with `shape '[-1, 6]' is invalid for input of
   size 7862` after 7 minutes of mask extraction.

2. **Self-matching `pgrep -f TOKEN` wait loop.** A wrapper invoked as
   `bash -c "while pgrep -f train_distill ...; done; bash run_pipeline.sh"`
   matched its OWN argv (because the bash -c string contained the literal
   "train_distill"), looped forever, and a fully-paid A100 sat idle.

These tests pin the permanent prevention so the bugs never come back.
