"""DCT-based flow compression for archive storage (Fridrich's proposal).

Compresses dense per-pair optical flow into low-rank DCT coefficients.
At inflate time, reconstructs the dense flow from stored coefficients.

Archive cost: n_pairs × n_coeffs × 2 channels × 2 bytes (float16)
  With 32 coefficients: 600 × 32 × 2 × 2 = 76.8 KB

Usage (compress time):
    flow = torch.load("raft_flow.pt")["flow"]  # (600, 2, H, W)
    coeffs = compress_flow_dct(flow, n_coeffs=32)
    torch.save(coeffs, "flow_dct.pt")

Usage (inflate time):
    coeffs = torch.load("flow_dct.pt")
    flow = decompress_flow_dct(coeffs, H=384, W=512)
