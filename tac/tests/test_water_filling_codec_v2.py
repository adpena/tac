"""Lane Ω-W-V2 — codec regression tests.

Covers the 5 council-mandated test classes from the V2 design spec:

    (a) test_v2_round_trip_bit_identical
    (b) test_v2_byte_savings_vs_v1_raw
    (c) test_v2_determinism_encode_twice_equal
    (d) test_v2_score_parity_decode_within_tol
    (e) test_v2_block_fp_ineligible_raises_gate_regression

Plus paranoia tests for the magic byte registry, header parsing, and
encode-time silent-default-blocking gates (Check 81 STRICT compliance).
All tests are pure-CPU; no GPU, no scorer load.
