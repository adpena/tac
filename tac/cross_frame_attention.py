"""Cross-frame attention for temporal coherence in neural renderers (Trick 20).

Patch-based cross-attention module that attends from current-frame features
to previous-frame features with real spatial key-value lookup.  This gives
the renderer an explicit mechanism to discover spatial displacement and
copy or adapt previous-frame information, improving:

    1. Temporal consistency (reduces flicker between consecutive frames).
    2. PoseNet score (PoseNet compares *pairs* — consistent features help).
    3. Efficiency (the renderer can reuse previous computation instead of
       re-deriving everything from the mask alone).

The attention is multi-head with a gated residual connection (initialized
to zero so the renderer starts as if attention were absent).

Architecture::

    Q = W_q(current_features)    shape: (B, C, H, W)
    K = W_k(previous_features)   shape: (B, C, H, W)
    V = W_v(previous_features)   shape: (B, C, H, W)

    # Downsample to 8x8 patches -> N patch tokens (e.g. 48x64 = 3072)
    Q_patches, K_patches, V_patches = patchify(Q, K, V)

    # Full cross-attention over patch tokens
    attn = softmax(Q_patches @ K_patches^T / sqrt(d_head))
    out_patches = attn @ V_patches

    # Upsample back to full resolution
    out = upsample(out_patches)
    output = current_features + gate * W_o(out)

The gate starts at 0, so training is stable even when prepended to an
already-trained renderer.

Usage::

    attn = CrossFrameAttention(dim=64, num_heads=4)
    out = attn(current_feats, previous_feats)

    # Or wrap an entire renderer:
    wrapped = CrossFrameRenderer(base_renderer, dim=64)
