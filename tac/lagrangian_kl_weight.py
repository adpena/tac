"""Proportional ratio controller for the KL-distillation auxiliary weight.

Replaces the hand-derived ``--kl-distill-weight`` constant in
``experiments/optimize_poses.py`` with a multiplicative log-space ratio
controller that drives the observed signal-to-noise ratio (KL
contribution / scorer contribution) toward an operator-specified target.

Bug 4 note (codex Round 3 — Option B):
    The previous docstring claimed this controller implemented
    "Lagrangian dual ascent" with a "convergence proof" citing Boyd &
    Vandenberghe §5.4 and Kivinen & Warmuth 1997. That claim was *not
    correct*: there is no explicit Lagrange multiplier λ here, no
    primal-dual saddle-point iteration, and no constraint residual
    being driven to zero by sub-gradient ascent. What the loop actually
    does is::

        log w_{t+1} = log w_t + η · log(ρ / snr_t)

    which is the textbook *proportional* (P-only) controller acting on
    the log of the SNR ratio. It is a heuristic that empirically
    converges on stationary observations to the fixed point
    ``snr = ρ`` because the update has the same sign as the residual
    ``log(ρ) − log(snr)``, but the convergence guarantees that would
    follow from a primal-dual analysis (sub-gradient convergence rates,
    KKT optimality, dual feasibility) do NOT apply.

    The controller WORKS in practice on the Lane G SNR-target tracking
    task (verified empirically on multiple Vast.ai runs); we keep the
    behavior unchanged and only remove the false convergence-proof
    claims from the docs. A truly Lagrangian variant (with explicit λ
    + constraint residual dynamics) belongs in
    :py:class:`tac.learnable_bit_quant.LagrangianRateController` —
    that's the *bit-budget* controller and IS a primal-dual loop
    (linear penalty + dual-variable sub-gradient ascent + KKT
    multiplier, Boyd §5.4).

Problem statement
-----------------
Let ``s_t`` denote the scorer loss at step ``t`` (the canonical
``seg_weight * seg_loss + pose_weight * pose_loss`` residual that drives
pose TTO) and ``k_t`` denote the raw KL-distillation auxiliary loss
(``tac.losses.kl_distill_segnet_only`` value at step ``t``). The aim of
Lane G is to use the KL signal as an *auxiliary guide* — strong enough
to nudge the renderer toward Quantizr-style soft-label SegNet logits but
weak enough that the primary scorer gradient still dominates. We
parameterise that goal as a *target SNR* ``ρ`` (default ``0.10`` =
KL is 10% of scorer, per the canonical Hinton 2015 auxiliary regime)
and update ``w`` so that the observed SNR
``snr_t = (w_t · k_t) / (s_t + ε)`` tracks ρ.

The update::

    log w_{t+1} = log w_t + η · log(ρ / snr_t)

is multiplicative (so ``w`` stays positive without an explicit
projection) and proportional to the log-space residual. On stationary
observations and η ≤ 1, the iterate contracts toward ``log w*`` where
``snr = ρ`` — that's the empirical fixed-point analysis we rely on
in production. Convergence rate is geometric in log space (a fixed
fractional reduction per step), but a formal proof analogous to
Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation requires diminishing step
sizes and bounded variance, which we do NOT enforce.

Stability guards
----------------
1. We bound ``log w`` to ``[log w_min, log w_max]`` to prevent runaway
   when ``s_t`` is transiently near zero.
2. We add ``ε = 1e-8`` to the denominator to avoid division by zero on
   the very first steps (when both losses are tiny).
3. The very first step uses the supplied ``initial_weight`` without an
   update (no observation available yet).

@dataclass
class KLWeightProportionalController:
    """Proportional (P-only) log-space ratio controller for the KL-distill weight.

    .. note::
       This is a heuristic ratio controller, NOT Lagrangian dual ascent.
       Despite the historical class name (kept as a deprecated alias —
       see :py:class:`LearnableKLWeight`), it does not maintain an
       explicit Lagrange multiplier and does not have the formal
       convergence properties of a primal-dual loop. Empirically it
       converges to the SNR-target fixed point on stationary
       observations; we use it as a reliable production controller for
       the Lane G auxiliary-distill weight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    snr_target:
        Target ratio of KL contribution to scorer contribution. Default
        ``0.10`` = KL is 10% of the scorer loss (Hinton 2015 auxiliary
        regime).
    initial_weight:
        Starting weight ``w_0``. Default ``0.002`` matches the Lane G v3
        hand-derived constant (so the controller starts from the
        previously-shipped operating point and only moves if the
        observed SNR drifts).
    eta:
        Dual-ascent step size in log-space (multiplier on
        ``log(ρ / snr_t)``). Default ``0.5`` — for ``η ≤ 1`` the
        geometric update is contractive on log-distance; ``η = 0.5``
        approaches the target by 50% per step in log-space when the
        observation is stationary, giving ~10 steps from a 1000× off-
        target initial weight.
    log_weight_min, log_weight_max:
        Bounds on ``log w`` to enforce stability when the scorer loss
        is transiently tiny. Defaults span 6 orders of magnitude
        around 1.0 (``e^-9 ≈ 1.2e-4`` → ``e^3 ≈ 20``).
    eps:
        Numerical stabiliser added to ``s_t`` before division.
