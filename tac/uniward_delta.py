"""Lane C: UNIWARD δ-injection on rendered frames at compress-time.

Detector-informed embedding in the Yousfi-2022 sense, on a contest where the
scorer IS the detector. Adds a sparse, variance-weighted, L∞-bounded
perturbation δ to renderer output BEFORE the camera-resolution upscale.
δ is optimized at compress-time against the actual PoseNet (and optional
SegNet) loss; at inflate-time it is a pure additive lookup table — NO
scorer is loaded. This satisfies Yousfi PR#35 strict-scorer-rule.

THEORY (Holub & Fridrich 2014, "Universal distortion function for
steganography in an arbitrary domain"):

    The S-UNIWARD distortion ρ(i, j) for embedding ±1 at pixel (i, j) is
    inversely proportional to the local wavelet residual energy:

        ρ(i, j) = Σ_d Σ_(u,v) | W_d(I)(u, v) |^{-1} * | K_d(i-u, j-v) |

    where W_d are directional wavelet filters (1st-level Daubechies
    decomposition) and K_d are the corresponding synthesis kernels.
    The intuition: textured pixels have high wavelet residual → low
    embedding cost → safe to perturb. Smooth pixels have near-zero
    wavelet residual → high embedding cost → DO NOT perturb.

    For Lane C we substitute the full Daubechies bank with directional
    Haar (already present in tac.fridrich._haar_wavelet_filters), which
    is the same approximation Yousfi 2017 ("Detector-Informed JPEG
    Steganography") uses in the digital-side application, and is what
    fridrich.compute_pixel_cost_map(method='uniward') already implements.

    The cost map gives PER-PIXEL L∞ budget:

        |δ(i, j, c)| ≤ L∞_BUDGET * (1 - cost_normalised(i, j))

    plus a global L∞ cap of 4/255 ≈ 0.0157 in [0, 1] units, equivalently
    4 in [0, 255] units. The Fridrich council bet is that the EfficientNet-B2
    SegNet stride-2 stem is BLIND to perturbations bounded this way, while
    PoseNet (FastViT-T12 on YUV6) sees the pose-error-canceling component.

DETERMINISTIC REPRODUCIBILITY (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable):

    Same renderer + masks + poses + seed + (compress device) → same δ bytes.

    This is enforced by:
    1. ``torch.manual_seed(seed)`` + ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8``
       BEFORE any cuBLAS/cuDNN call.
    2. Adam optimizer over a deterministic batched loop (sorted pair
       indices, fixed batch size).
    3. Top-K sparsity selection by ``torch.topk`` is deterministic
       (CUDA topk has tie-breaking by lower index).
    4. Quantization to int8 via ``round-to-nearest-even`` (PyTorch default).
    5. The packed bytes are written via ``zlib.compress(level=9)`` which
       is deterministic given identical input bytes.

    Mac-MPS vs CUDA WILL produce different δ bytes because the underlying
    PoseNet softmax + YUV6 chroma kernels differ (CLAUDE.md drift table).
    Lane C MUST run on CUDA — both for the bytes-stable provenance and to
    avoid the 23x PoseNet drift on MPS.

WIRE FORMAT (delta.bin):

    [4 bytes]   magic = b"UWD1"
    [4 bytes]   header_len (uint32 LE)
    [N bytes]   header_json (utf-8) with:
                  schema_version, n_frames, H, W, n_kept, l_inf_budget,
                  quantize_bits (always 8), scale, seed, sha256s of
                  (renderer, masks, poses) for provenance.
    [n_kept*4]  flat pixel indices (uint32 LE), shape =
                  frame_idx * H * W * 3 + (y * W + x) * 3 + channel
                  i.e. "fully flat in (frame, y, x, c)" order.
                  Channel-flat means the apply path is one scatter_add
                  with no fan-out per pixel (matches Hotz R1 #1 layout
                  used in gradient_corrections).
    [n_kept]    quantized δ values (int8 LE), dequant = v * scale / 127.

The whole thing is zlib-compressed at level 9 (matches gradient_corrections
codec). For a 1% sparsity at 1200x384x512x3 ≈ 7M pixel-channels, n_kept ≈
70k → header(~250B) + 70k*5 = ~350KB raw → ~100KB compressed; budget says
≤5KB total which forces sparsity ≤0.014% of pixel-channels (~1k slots) and
hard top-K selection. The optimizer below enforces the budget by
``--target-bytes`` knob on the packer.
