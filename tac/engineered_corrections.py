"""Lane EC: Engineered Corrections (canonical tac-side API).

Lane EC produces small per-frame correction deltas that ship with the
submission archive and are applied additively at inflate time. Per the
2026-04-28 skunkworks council "EC-first composition" rationale
(.omx/research/lane_g_v3_stacking_skunkworks_20260428.md), engineered
corrections compose well with every other lane because they are a pure
additive correction applied AFTER the renderer's forward pass.

Predicted band [contest-CUDA]: [0.85, 1.10] solo from a Lane A 1.15 anchor.
The downside is bounded by --max-artifact-bytes (council Quantizr).

Strict-scorer-rule: corrections.bin is DATA, not MODEL. The inflate path
loads + applies corrections without ever importing PoseNet or SegNet.
The compress-time gradient search (experiments/engineered_quant_noise.py
or experiments/precompute_gradient_corrections.py) is the only place
scorers are touched.

This module is the canonical tac-side API; the heavy compute-time
implementation lives in experiments/precompute_gradient_corrections.py
and the entire test suite (test_lane_ec_v2_greedy.py + Lane I sparse
codec tests) imports from there. We re-export the load-bearing functions
here so downstream consumers can do::

    from tac.engineered_corrections import (
        compute_per_frame_corrections,
        apply_corrections_at_inflate,
        serialize_corrections,
        load_corrections,
    )

without reaching into experiments/.

        top_k_pct: fixed-budget percentage (V1 only). Ignored for greedy.
        quantize_bits: 4, 8, or 16. 8 is the default; ~30% smaller than
            16 with no measurable score impact at ``--max-delta=2``.
