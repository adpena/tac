"""Lane Ω water-fill bit allocator (per-weight bit-depth from Hessian importance).

Given a per-weight Fisher importance tensor I(w_ij) and a total bit budget B,
allocate per-weight bit-depths bits[w_ij] ∈ [min_bits, max_bits] so that:

    sum(bits) ≤ B
    bits[w] ≈ round(c * I(w)^alpha)  clamped to [min_bits, max_bits]

The constant `c` is found by binary search so the budget is satisfied while
keeping the allocation monotonically nondecreasing in importance.

This is the cousin of HAWQ (Dong 2019) and OBQ (Frantar 2022) — same
"importance → bit-budget" idea but applied per-weight (not per-layer or
per-block) and driven by the contest's hard-pair Fisher signal (memory:
project_lane_omega_bit_budget_hessian_aware_quantization +
project_lane_w_hard_pair_self_compress_premise_20260427).

CLAUDE.md compliance:
    * Pure CPU function (no GPU dependence). Deterministic for a given input.
    * No CLI here — call sites in profile_hessian_per_weight.py /
      remote_lane_omega_hessian_qat.sh consume this directly.
    * No global state.
    * Tested to: budget conservation, monotonic in importance, deterministic.
