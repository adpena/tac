"""Lane C δ compliance attestation utilities (Codex R5-2 #4 fix, 2026-04-27).

The Lane C δ pipeline is scorer-derived; Yousfi PR #35 strict-scorer-rule
may class it as non-compliant. To prevent operators from self-asserting
contest approval at δ-build time, this module enforces a TWO-PARTY trust
model:

  1. The δ producer (``experiments/optimize_uniward_delta.py``) can only
     issue ``pending_ruling`` or ``rejected``. ``approved`` is REJECTED
     by argparse choices.

  2. To bundle an ``approved`` δ into a submission archive,
     ``experiments/build_baseline_archive.py`` requires a separate
     attestation JSON file at the canonical path
     ``.omx/state/lane_c_compliance_attestations/<sha256>.json``,
     where ``<sha256>`` is the SHA256 of the actual ``delta.bin`` bytes.

  3. The attestation is produced by a SEPARATE tool
     (``tools/sign_lane_c_compliance.py``) which records the approver's
     identity, the ruling text, the timestamp, the git HEAD, and the
     ``whoami`` value. The tool refuses to run with empty ruling text.

The attestation file's ``delta_sha256`` MUST match the bundled δ.bin's
actual sha256 — this catches typos, copy-paste between attestations,
and any drift between the δ that was approved and the δ that ships.

Why a separate file rather than a signature embedded in the blob:
  - The blob's compliance_status is operator-controlled at build time;
    the attestation is operator-controlled at SIGN time and lives in
    a different place. You need BOTH to ship.
  - The attestation is git-committable: a future auditor can inspect
    the commit log to see who approved what and when.
  - SHA-keyed file naming makes "wrong δ but right attestation"
    impossible: the gate cross-checks SHA before accepting.

         AttestationMismatch.
      5. Look up ``approver`` in the trust-root pubkey registry. Not
         found ⇒ AttestationApproverNotInTrustRoot.
      6. Recompute ``canonical_signed_payload`` over the loaded record
         and verify the Ed25519 signature against the registered
         pubkey. Bad ⇒ AttestationSignatureInvalid.

    The trust root file at
    ``.omx/state/lane_c_compliance_attestations/trust_root_pubkeys.json``
    lists the council members whose signatures count as approval. Only
    the pubkeys are committed to the repo; the matching private keys
    live OUTSIDE the repo on each council member's machine.

    Returns the parsed Attestation on full success; raises a specific
    exception type on each failure mode so the caller (the archive
    builder) can produce actionable error messages.

    """Write a SIGNED attestation JSON for a δ blob at the canonical path.

    Codex R5-3 #1 fix (2026-04-27): a ``private_key`` parameter is now
    REQUIRED (no default). The function signs the canonical-JSON
    serialization of the trust-bearing fields with Ed25519 and writes
    the signature into the attestation file. Without the matching
    pubkey in the trust root, the resulting attestation will not verify.

    Codex R5-3 #3 fix (2026-04-27): the file write is now ATOMIC. We
    use ``open(path, 'x')`` (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) when overwrite=False, which
    is race-safe across concurrent signers. For overwrite=True we write
    to a temp file in the same dir and ``os.replace`` over the target,
    which is also atomic on POSIX.

    Args:
        blob: the δ.bin bytes being approved. The file path is derived
            from sha256(blob) — same as the verifier expects.
        approver: free-form identity (e.g. "yousfi", "council"). Must be
            non-empty AND must match a key in the trust-root pubkey
            registry, otherwise ``verify_attestation_for_blob`` will
            refuse the resulting attestation.
        ruling_text: free-form justification (e.g. URL to council
            ruling thread, paragraph text). Must be non-empty.
        signed_by_user: typically ``getpass.getuser()`` or whoami.
        git_head: current git commit sha for forensic context.
        private_key: Ed25519 private key. Either an already-loaded
            ``cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519.
            Ed25519PrivateKey`` instance or 32 raw bytes. Tests pass
            in-memory keys; the signing tool loads from a PEM file
            OUTSIDE the repo.
        delta_path_at_signing: optional; recorded so a future auditor
            can find the build artifact. NOT signed.
        root: optional override for the repo root (tests use this).
        signed_at_utc: ISO8601 timestamp; if None, computed now.
        overwrite: if False (default) and a file already exists at the
            target path, refuse atomically — pre-existing attestation
            may have different ruling text and overwriting is a
            forensic loss. (Codex R5-3 #3: atomic exclusive-create.)

    Returns:
        Path to the written attestation file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: empty approver / ruling_text / git_head /
            signed_by_user, or invalid private_key argument.
        FileExistsError: an attestation already exists at the path
            and ``overwrite=False`` — RACE-SAFE via O_EXCL.
