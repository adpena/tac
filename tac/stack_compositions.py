"""Cross-lane composition glue (per ``docs/stacking_architecture.md``).

This module is the canonical way to *stack* lane outputs at the archive
level WITHOUT a refactor of either lane. Lanes that follow the
"renderer-encoder + sidecar-additive" composition rule from the design
contract can be composed by simply consuming each lane's already-built
artifact and writing a deterministic zip.

The first concrete composition lives here:

    compose_jnwcs_with_ec(...)
        Stacks a Lane J-NWCS-encoded ``renderer.bin`` (the
        sensitivity-aware NWC weight codec output) with a Lane EC
        ``gradient_corrections.bin`` sidecar, producing a single contest
        archive that the standard ``inflate.sh`` consumes without any
        special-case wiring. The two artifacts attack the rate wedge from
        DIFFERENT layers (weight-bit allocation vs inflate-time pixel
        residuals) so they are complementary, not redundant.

Strict-scorer-rule (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable) preservation
----------------------------------------------------------
* Lane J-NWCS produces a renderer.bin whose loader does NOT touch
  PoseNet/SegNet (the codec's encoder/decoder MLPs are bundled INSIDE the
  renderer.bin wire format and reconstruct weights at inflate time
  without any external scorer state).
* Lane EC produces a sparse-int8 ``gradient_corrections.bin`` that
  ``inflate_renderer.py`` discovers by name and applies as a numpy
  additive overlay (see ``apply_corrections_at_inflate`` in
  ``tac.engineered_corrections``). No torch autograd, no scorer.
* Therefore the *composition* trivially inherits the strict-scorer-rule
  property — neither artifact can sneak in a scorer dependency through
  the other. ``validate_jnwcs_ec_composition`` enforces this with a
  byte-level magic check on renderer.bin.

Determinism
-----------
* Every archive built by this module uses a fixed ZipInfo timestamp
  (``(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)``) so two compose calls with byte-identical
  inputs produce byte-identical archives. This is the same convention
  ``tac.lossless.submission.build_submission_zip`` and the canonical
  remote bootstraps follow (codex R5-r6 #5).

Anchor reuse
------------
* This module is a PURE COMPOSITION layer. It does NOT retrain anything
  and it does NOT re-download artifacts. Callers feed it paths to
  artifacts that have ALREADY been produced by their respective lane
  bootstraps (Lane J-NWCS Stage 5, Lane EC Stage 2). The
  ``bit_budget_split_search`` helper enumerates compose configurations
  by re-running each lane's *artifact-producing* logic with different
  rate budgets — each invocation builds a single new archive but does
  NOT re-train the underlying NWCS codec or re-search EC corrections
  from scratch.
