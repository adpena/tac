"""Lane Ω-V2 — per-WEIGHT learnable bit-depth via Lagrangian dual ascent.

The mathematically-optimal evolution of Lane Ω-V1's water-fill heuristic.

Math (council Yousfi+Fridrich+Hotz):
    Lane Ω-V1 used a closed-form water-fill allocator
        bits_ij ∝ I(w_ij)^α   with α=0.5 hard-coded
    derived from a high-rate Gaussian-noise approximation
        D(b) ≈ σ²/12 · 2^(-2b)
    minimised under the constraint sum(bits_ij) ≤ B by Lagrangian.

    The closed-form allocation is OPTIMAL only when the actual fake-quant
    distortion is locally Gaussian. In our setting it isn't: STE round +
    per-output-channel scale + scorer non-linearity make the true distortion
    landscape decidedly non-Gaussian, and α=0.5 is just a guess at the slope.

    Lane Ω-V2 directly learns bits_ij as a continuous parameter via
    Lagrangian dual ascent. The KKT condition at the constrained optimum
    (rate-distortion duality) is
        ∂D/∂bits_ij = -λ · ∂R/∂bits_ij    ∀ (i,j)
    where ∂R/∂bits_ij = 1 (each weight contributes 1 unit per bit).

    Setting λ via dual ascent (sub-gradient on the constraint violation)
    converges to the SAME optimum as water-fill IF the high-rate
    approximation holds, but ALSO adapts to the actual fake-quant
    distortion landscape when it doesn't. So Lane Ω-V2 is at-least-as-good
    as Ω-V1 in the limit, and strictly better when the distortion is
    non-Gaussian (i.e. the regime we actually care about).

Implementation pattern: this module mirrors Lane S's
``self_compress.LearnableBitDepth`` + ``SelfCompressingConv2d`` but extends
the bit-depth from per-CHANNEL to per-WEIGHT. The differentiable
parameterisation uses ``softplus(raw)`` to keep bits >= 0; an upper
clamp at 8 keeps the encoder representable.

CLAUDE.md compliance:
    * Pure PyTorch. CUDA-required; no MPS fallback (caller decides device).
    * Tested: gradient flows through bits + weights, 8-bit ≈ identity,
      1-bit clusters to ±max, swap respects protected layers.
    * No global state.

        Round 7 supersedes Round 6's q-delta FD ``grad_output · (qp − qm)/2``
        which produced sign-inverted bit updates under the realistic MSE
        chain (e.g., w=+0.1, b=2 zero bin: Round 6 gave +0.05 → SGD lowered
        bits → MSE went 0.01→0.81; Round 7 gives -0.04 → SGD raises bits ✓).
        See the backward() body for the worked derivation.

    The bits gradient is the load-bearing piece of Lane Ω-V2 — it is
    what lets dual ascent on λ + SGD on bits converge to the KKT optimum.

        #   the FD probe interval [q_bminus, q_bplus]. For our quantizer
        #   levels(b) = 2^(b-1) - 1 = {1, 3, 7, 15, ...} that interval
        #   spans an O(1) jump (e.g. b=2→1: q goes from 0 to ±scale). So
        #   the linearisation breaks WHEREVER the loss has noticeable
        #   curvature in the probe range — which is exactly the canonical
        #   MSE chain (Lane Ω-V2's actual training objective via the rate
        #   penalty + downstream distortion proxies).

    """Linear Lagrangian rate penalty: ``λ × (mean_bits − target)``.

    Bug 2 fix (codex Round 4):
        The Round 3 fix kept a hidden ``F.relu(residual)`` in the primal
        surrogate (``λ × max(0, mean_bits − target)``). That destroys the
        KKT property the docstring promised: under slack
        (``mean_bits < target``) the gradient w.r.t. bits is ZERO, so the
        bit allocator only feels rate pressure when *already* over budget
        — equilibrium drifts above target whenever the slack-side dual
        decay is faster than the over-budget excursion that re-engages
        the hinge. The textbook primal-dual pair for an inequality
        constraint is::

            primal:  λ · (mean_bits − target)            # linear, no ReLU
            dual:    λ ← max(0, λ + η · (mean_bits − target))  # ascent + clamp

        The clamp belongs in the *dual* update (KKT non-negativity of the
        multiplier), NOT in the primal penalty. Below target the linear
        primal term contributes a negative gradient that *rewards* more
        bits, but the dual decays λ → 0 simultaneously — equilibrium
        lands at the boundary ``mean_bits = target`` with ``λ ≥ 0``,
        which is exactly the KKT condition for ``mean_bits ≤ target``.

    Backward-compat: ``lambda_rate`` accepts either a ``float`` (legacy
    fixed-multiplier path) or a :py:class:`LagrangianRateController`
    instance (canonical primal-dual path). When a controller is passed
    its current :py:attr:`~LagrangianRateController.lambda_rate` is used.

    Round 13 (C-1) — ``target_bits_per_weight`` is now Optional. The
    controller already pins the target on construction; passing both a
    controller and an explicit ``target_bits_per_weight`` is *ambiguous*
    (the previous behaviour silently discarded the explicit value), so
    we now raise ``ValueError`` instead of swallowing the conflict. The
    legacy float-multiplier path still requires an explicit non-None
    target — there is no controller to fall back to in that case.

    Round 13 (C-2) — the layered path uses the layer's actual
    ``raw.device`` so CUDA training does not raise a device-mismatch.

    Round 14 finding 3 (R15) — the no-layer early-exit now ALSO infers
    the device from the FIRST parameter / buffer of ``model`` (via
    :func:`_infer_model_device`), so a CUDA caller with a zero-layer
    model does not crash on ``cuda_loss + cpu_zero``. PyTorch does
    NOT silently promote across devices for binary ops (only across
    dtypes), so the previous ``_zero_on_device(None)`` early-exit
    would have raised a "Expected all tensors to be on the same
    device" error the moment a model with zero learnable-bit layers
    was on CUDA — which is the canonical first-test-on-GPU
    configuration. Round 13 fixed the layered path; Round 14
    finding 3 closes the no-layer gap.

    Returns 0 (zero-dim tensor) when the model has no learnable-bit
    layers, so callers can ``loss + compute_learnable_bit_rate_penalty(...)``
    unconditionally.
