"""Lane Ω FrozenBitFakeQuant — per-element bit-depth STE fake-quantization.

Given a weight tensor W and a SAME-SHAPE uint8 tensor `bits` specifying the
bit-depth for each element, produce a quantized W with each element rounded
to the nearest representable value in its assigned bit-depth. Per-output-
channel scale (max(|w|) over each output channel) gives proper dynamic-range
coverage without needing a global scale.

Backward = STE (straight-through estimator): gradient w.r.t. weight = upstream
gradient. Bits tensor is FROZEN (uint8, no_grad) — Lane Ω's bit allocation is
decided BEFORE QAT (Phase 2 water-fill) and the QAT loop only fine-tunes the
underlying float weight to minimize loss given the fixed per-weight bit-depth.

Why this design (vs Lane S's LearnableBitDepth):
    * Lane S learns per-CHANNEL bit-depth via Lagrangian rate penalty.
    * Lane Ω freezes per-WEIGHT bit-depth from a Hessian profile — much
      finer resolution but much smaller search space (the gradient signal
      for "how many bits should THIS individual weight get" is too noisy
      to learn directly; instead we measure it once via Fisher importance,
      then freeze).

Per-output-channel scaling (not per-tensor):
    * Per-tensor max scaling lets a single outlier kill the precision of
      every other weight in the layer.
    * Per-output-channel scaling matches what Lane S / SCv1 / FP4A all do
      and what Quantizr / OBQ literature recommends.

Symmetric round-to-nearest:
    * For b bits, representable values are {-(2^(b-1)-1), …, 0, …, 2^(b-1)-1}
      multiplied by scale / (2^(b-1)-1). For b=1 we use {-scale, +scale}.
    * Quantization is symmetric → no zero-point storage needed.

CLAUDE.md compliance:
    * Pure PyTorch. CUDA-compatible. No MPS fallback.
    * Tested: gradient flow (STE), 8-bit near-identity, 1-bit clustering,
      per-channel scale correctness, finite outputs.
