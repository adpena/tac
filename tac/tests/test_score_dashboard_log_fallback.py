"""Regression test for tools/score_dashboard.py auth_eval.log fallback path.

After commit dbb0032d, the dashboard scans `auth_eval.log` files in dirs not
already covered by canonical `contest_auth_eval*.json`, extracting embedded
RESULT_JSON for visibility into Lightning/Vast.ai dispatches whose JSON
didn't sync back. This added 293 scores (5.6×) to the dashboard view.

These tests pin the new behavior so a future refactor doesn't silently
re-introduce the blind spot:

  test_dashboard_picks_up_log_files
    Asserts at least 1 score row's path ends in `auth_eval.log` —
    confirms the fallback parser is reachable from `scan()`.

  test_dashboard_pr106_frontier_surfaces
    Asserts the canonical PR106 score (0.20945673) appears with the
    expected archive bytes (186,239) — the public frontier at top of
    `operator_briefing` Phase 2.

  test_dashboard_canonical_json_takes_precedence
    Asserts dirs with BOTH .json AND .log only produce ONE row (the
    JSON one), preserving the precedence ordering documented in the
    scan() docstring.

  test_dashboard_log_parser_extracts_components
    Asserts the log-parsed rows have populated seg_dist_avg /
    pose_dist_avg / device fields (the columns the operator briefing
    relies on for in-band/out-of-band detection).
