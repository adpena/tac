"""Regression tests for Round 3 council-prescribed preflight checks 82+83.

Check 82 — check_callsite_contracts_satisfied: catches the Lane GP class of
bug where a kwarg lands in a helper but the actual call site never passes it.

Check 83 — check_no_proxy_metric_drives_decision: catches the STC class of
bug where a kill/promote decision is made from MPS/CPU evidence without a
contest-CUDA artifact in the same paragraph.
