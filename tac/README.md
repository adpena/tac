# tac -- Task-Aware Codec

Neural video compression optimized for downstream perception models.

tac trains tiny CNN post-filters that correct decoded video frames by backpropagating through frozen perception networks. The filter learns corrections that minimize the scorer's distortion metric, not generic pixel quality.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tac
```

Optional extras:

```bash
pip install tac[mlx]        # Apple Silicon acceleration
pip install tac[viz]         # Plotly visualization
pip install tac[notebooks]   # Marimo notebook support
```

## Quick start

```python
from tac import Trainer, TrainConfig, build_postfilter

# Build a 3-layer residual CNN post-filter
model = build_postfilter("standard", hidden=64)

# Configure training with QAT, EMA, and best-checkpoint selection
config = TrainConfig(hidden=64, epochs=1000, alpha=20, tag="my_run")

# Train against frozen PoseNet + SegNet scorers
trainer = Trainer(model, config, device="mps")
trainer.fit(comp_pairs, gt_pairs, posenet, segnet, sal_weights)
```

## What it does

Video compression codecs (H.264, AV1) optimize for human perception -- PSNR, SSIM, perceptual quality. But many downstream consumers are neural networks, not humans. A self-driving car's perception stack does not care about perceptual quality; it cares about whether PoseNet and SegNet produce correct outputs from the decoded frames.

tac bridges this gap:

1. **Compress** video with a standard codec (H.265, AV1)
2. **Post-filter** decoded frames through a tiny learned CNN
3. **Score** using the actual downstream perception models
4. **Backpropagate** through the frozen scorers to train the filter

The post-filter learns artifact corrections that specifically help the downstream models, even if those corrections look invisible (or worse) to human eyes.

## Architecture

tac provides two processing lanes:

- **CPU lane**: Standard codec + learned post-filter. The post-filter is a 3-layer residual CNN (~390KB int8) that runs in real-time on CPU.
- **GPU lane**: Mask extraction + neural rendering. SegNet masks are compressed at extreme ratios, then a neural renderer reconstructs RGB frames from masks alone.
